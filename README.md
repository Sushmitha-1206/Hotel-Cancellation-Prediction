# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict hotel reservation cancellations using a real-world dataset. The workflow begins with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), involving univariate analysis, outlier detection, and removal of data anomalies. Key irregular entries—such as excessive counts of adults or children and unrealistic night stays—were filtered out. These steps ensured cleaner data and more reliable inputs for model training.

The core of the project involves training a Random Forest classifier to classify reservations as likely to be canceled or not. The data was refined through correlation analysis and hypothesis testing to select features with predictive power. Techniques such as duplicate removal, null value treatment, and type casting were used to prepare the data for machine learning. The trained model was evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to validate its effectiveness in identifying cancellation patterns.

Beyond just model training, this project provides valuable insights into customer booking behavior and the factors influencing cancellations. By understanding correlations between booking features—such as meal plans, room types, and number of guests—hotels can better strategize resource allocation and customer service efforts. This project is structured for extensibility, enabling future enhancements like model comparison, cross-validation, or integration into decision-support systems.
